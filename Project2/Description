Matrix Multiplication using Map-Reduce
Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a Map-Reduce program on Hadoop to multiply two sparse matrices.

Project Description
For this project, you are asked to implement matrix multiplication in Map-Reduce. This is described in the last slide in bigdata-l03.pdf and in Section 2.3.9 (page 38) in Map-Reduce and the New Software Stack. Do not use the method in Section 2.3.10. Here is the pseudo code to multiply two matrices M and N. The first Map-Reduce job finds all possible products Mik*Nkj, for all k, by joining M and N:

// mapper for matrix M
map(key,line) =
  split line into 3 values: i,k,m
  emit(k,new Triple(0,i,m))

// mapper for matrix N
map(key,line) =
  split line into 3 values: k,j,n
  emit(k,new Triple(1,j,n))

reduce(k,values) =
  M_values = all triples (0,i,m) from values
  N_values = all triples (1,j,n) from values
  for (0,i,m) in M_values
     for (1,j,n) in N_values
        emit(new Pair(i,j),m*n)
The second Map-Reduce adds all products for each pair (i,j):

map(pair,value) =
  emit(pair,value)

reduce(pair,values) =
  sum = 0.0
  for v in values
    sum += v
  emit(pair,sum)
You should use two Map-Reduce jobs in the same Java file project2/src/main/java/Multiply.java. 
You should modify Multiply.java only. In your Java main program, args[0] is the first input matrix M, args[1] is the second input matrix N, args[2] is the directory name to pass the intermediate results from the first Map-Reduce job to the second, and args[3] is the output directory. 
The file formats for the input and output must be text and the file format of the intermediate results must be sequence file format (binary). 
There are two small sparse matrices 4*3 and 3*3 in the files M-matrix-small.txt and N-matrix-small.txt for testing in local mode. 
Their matrix multiplication must return the 4*3 matrix in solution-small.txt. Then, there are two moderate-sized matrices 1000*500 and 500*1000 in the files M-matrix-large.txt and M-matrix-large.txt for testing in distributed mode. 
The first and last lines of the matrix multiplication of these two matrices must must be similar to those in solution-large.txt.
